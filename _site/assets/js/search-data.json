Redirect the main folder but leave subfolders as they are . This is to redirect the main landing page of the old page to the new one but keeping the rest of the section/recursive path the same.

RewriteRule ^folder/(.*)$ https://www.newdestination.com [R=301,NC,L] Redirect 301 /folder https://www.newdestinations.com . This will redirect https://irawan.io/folder and subfolders e.g https://irawan.io/folder/sub-folders/* to https://newdestinations.com .
