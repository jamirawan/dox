# Drupal quick guide

![Drupal logo](https://www.drupal.org/files/cta/graphic/Wordmark2_white_RGB.svg)

My first ever Drupal website was a [wedding magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080627/http://wishdreamweddings.com.au/) I built for the NT News in Darwin in 2010. It was not easy building it but learned a lot from there.

Drupal won the most dreaded web framework according to the [Stackoverflow survey in 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks) and that tells us a lot about how complicated it is to use. But, it's still being used by programmer who's got a sense of adventure and like challanges. 

Although there is no such thing as a `quick guide` for webdev framework manual, I make this documentation a quick reference for myself just to remind me of the steps I took.
